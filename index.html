        <p id="p1">Welcome to Code Nation, where are goal is to introduce you to the magic of computer programming, and to make the experience fun instead of frustrating and scary like many other sites on the web. Each link above will take you a page that gives a brief introduction to that particular programming language along with a link to download a text editor and a link to a tutorial on how to write your first lines of code. The main thing everyone hopefully takes away from this page is to have fun and hopefully learn something new in the process.</p>

        <p id="p2">Computer Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a particular task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as Javascript, Python, C# and many many more. Programming languages are classified into four types. <span class="fun">Good Luck!!! and remember Have Fun!!!</span></p>

            <a href="#procedural"><h3>Procedural Programming Language</h3></a>

        <a class="prog_styles" id="procedural"><h2>Procedural Programming Language</h2></a>

        <p>Procedural Programming languages are used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. Typically this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional programming language. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function's value returns. For example, printing out information.</p>

        <a class="prog_styles" id="functional"><h2>Functional Programming Language</h2></a>

        <p>Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions. The functional programming's primary focus is on the return values of functions. Functional languages are usually easier and a simple definition is "writing a program only in pure functions." </p>

        <a class="prog_styles" id="script"><h2>Scripting Programming Language</h2></a>

        <p>These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems. Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.</p>

        <a class="prog_styles" id="object"><h2>Object-Oriented Programming Language</h2></a>

        <p>This type of programming language is based on the concept of "Objects" which can contain data and code. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out objects that interact with one another.</p>
