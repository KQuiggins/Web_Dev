                <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consist of at least source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others such as Lazarus, do not. An IDE allows developers to start programming new applications quickly because multiple utilities don't need to be manually configured and integrated as part of the setup process. Developers also don't need to spend hours individually learning how to use different tools when every utility is represented in the same workbench.</p>
                
                <p>By far my favorite environment to work in is vsCode out of the box it may not be a full fledged IDE but with all the extensions made available there is not much it can not do. Visual Studio Code is a source code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python, and C++. It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Source control is built in to vsCode. It has a dedicated tab inside of the menu bar where you can access the version control settings and view changes you made in the current project.</p>
